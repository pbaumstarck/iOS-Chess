iOS-Chess
=========

Simple Chess application I started to get familiar with iOS development. I stopped when I realized I was spending more time getting _en passant_ passing correct than I was actually learning about Objective-C. Below is a screenshot of gameplay, where the white queen is selected, yellow boxes indicate valid moves, and red boxes indicate valid captures:
